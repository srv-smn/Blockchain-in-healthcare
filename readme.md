# Blockchain in Health Care

### *The healthcare industry is constantly reforming and adopting new shapes with respect to technological evolutions and transitions. One of the crucial requirements in the current smart healthcare systems is the protection of patients' sensitive data against potential adversaries.Patients are mostly unaware regarding which entities are storing and using their medical data without their consent.*

### **We are building a decentralized application on web 3.0 that can ensure only authorized entities can access the patient's medical information. We proposed a smart contract able to protect the privacy of the patients as well.**
